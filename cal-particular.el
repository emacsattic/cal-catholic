; The commemoration of Our Lady of Guadaloupe is a feast in all the
; dioceses of America.
; 
; From the June 1999 NCCB/USCC Committee on the Liturgy Newsletter:
; 
; Feast of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Guadalupe
; 
; On March 25, 1999, Cardinal Jorge Medina-Estevez, Prefect of the
; Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments,
; published a decree declaring the celebration of the Blessed Virgin
; Mary of Guadalupe on December 12th as a feast in all the countries of
; America. This decree implements the decision of Pope John Paul II as
; expressed in his Apostolic Exhortation, Ecclesia in America. In a
; letter to Cardinal Medina dated June 25, 1999, Bishop Joseph A
; Fiorenza, President of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops,
; noted that "The Holy Father's decision is particularly gratifying to
; the bishops of our episcopal conference in the light of our earlier
; decision to establish Our Lady of Guadalupe as a Feast in the dioceses
; of the United States of America, as confirmed by a decree of your
; Congregation on January 8, 1988 (Prot. N. 1341/87)." The following
; unofficial translation of the Latin decree is provided as a service to
; our readers.

; CONGREGATION FOR DIVINE WORSHIP AND THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SACRAMENTS
; 
; Prot. 803/99/L
; 
; DECREE
; 
; Concerning the feast of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Guadalupe to be
; celebrated annually on December 12 in all America
; 
; In consenting to the Divine Word, Mary, the daughter of Adam, became
; the Mother of Jesus and, while embracing the salvific will of God with
; a full heart and unburdened by any sin, she devoted herself completely
; as the handmaid of the Lord to the person and works of her Son,
; serving the mystery of redemption under Him and through Him by the
; grace of God. She poured Life itself into the world, renewing all
; things, and appearing for us as a Mother in the order of grace as
; well. Finally, raised to the glory of heaven, she accompanies the
; Continued pilgrim Church always and everywhere with motherly love, so
; that the Church, contemplating the image of her own perfection and
; mission in the holy God-bearer (Theotokos), may instruct all nations
; with the praise of the Gospel's salvation, and, by the working of the
; Holy Spirit, fill the whole world with children of a new people. For
; this reason, the Christian people greatly revere this Mother and
; Queen, and invoke her aid in the difficulties and trials of life, so
; that she may obtain grace for them by the mercy of God.
; 
; The close relationship between this Tender Mother and the Christian
; faithful in America was manifested in a wonderful way on the hill
; known as Tepeyac, where the Mother of God under the title of the
; Blessed Virgin Mary of Guadalupe was already fervently honored for
; four centuries as the Empress of all the Americas, signifying by her
; own appearance the necessity of a perfect union of the Word of God
; with the humanity of native peoples in evangelizing this
; Continent. Hence, from the beginning of the modern age, she offered an
; extraordinary example of care particularly for the poor and the
; indigenous. This cult of the Virgin has been spread by continual
; observance even to the present, so that, in approaching the third
; millennium of the Savior's incarnation, the members of the Special
; Synod of Bishops of America, at the close of their meeting in Rome in
; 1997, fervently invoked blessed Mary, Virgin of Guadalupe, as
; Patroness of all America and as the star of both the first and now of
; the new evangelization of this same Continent.
; 
; Likewise, the Supreme Pontiff, John Paul II, acceding to the requests
; of the synod Fathers, and joyfully receiving their recommendation,
; recalled on the first anniversary of the Plenary Council for Latin
; American, assembled in Rome, through his Apostolic Exhortation
; Eccelsia in America (The Church in America), promulgated on 22
; January, 1999 in Mexico City, and then graciously approved in his
; homily on the following day, delivered in the Basilica of Our Lady of
; Guadalupe, that in all America the celebration of Blessed Mary, the
; Virgin of Guadalupe, is to be observed henceforth with the rank of
; feast, thereby earnestly desiring that this same Virgin, through whose
; intercession the faith of the first disciples was strengthened, would
; lead the Church of this Continent with her maternal love and that she
; would obtain an outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the Church so that
; a new evangelization might flourish by the witness of Christian life.
; 
; Therefore, this Dicastery declares that this feast be inscribed into
; the calendars of each nation and territory of America on 12th day of
; December, so that in each diocese of that Continent it may be
; celebrated on the same day annually, while with the rank of a
; solemnity where those concessions have been permanently granted by the
; Apostolic See by decree or norms already in effect, in favor of the
; same territories and their churches.
; 
; To those texts already approved for this celebration may be added the
; Spanish texts attached to this decree which may be used henceforth and
; are hereby declared editiones typicae. Indeed, other vernacular
; editions must be devised according to the norm of law, and approved by
; the Episcopal Conference and confirmed by the Holy See.
; 
; All things to the contrary notwithstanding.
; 
; Given from the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline for
; the Sacraments, on the Solemnity of the Annunciation of the Lord, 25
; March 1999.
